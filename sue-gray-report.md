#### FINDINGS OF SECOND PERMANENT SECRETARY¶S INVESTIGATION INTO

#### ALLEGED GATHERINGS: REPORT

1. On 8 December 2021 the Prime Minister asked the Cabinet Secretary to carry
    out an investigation into allegations reported in the media relating to gatherings
    in No 10 Downing Street and the Department for Education during November
    and December 2020.
2. On 17 December 2021 the Cabinet Secretary recused himself from the
    investigation as a result of allegations concerning an online quiz held by his
    private office in the Cabinet Office on 17 December 2020 in 70 Whitehall. It was
    at this point that I was asked to lead this work.
3. The terms of reference for the investigation were published on 9 December
    2021. The primary purpose of the investigation was to establish a general
    understanding of the nature of the gatherings including: attendance; the setting;
    and the purpose, with reference to adherence to the guidance in place at the
    time.
4. On 31 January 2022 I published an update (appended to this report and
    including the detailed terms of reference and the timeline of regulations) which
    set out the methodology of the investigation; the 16 gatherings within its scope;
    and a number of limited, general findings. It also confirmed that the Metropolitan
    Police Service had decided to investigate events on the following dates:

```
x 20 May 2020: a gathering in the garden of No 10 Downing Street for No 10 staff;
```
```
x 18 June 2020: a gathering in No 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, 70
Whitehall on the departure of a No 10 official;
```
```
x 19 June 2020: a gathering in the Cabinet room in No 10 Downing Street on the
Prime Minister¶s birthday;
```
```
x 13 November 2020: a gathering in the No 10 Downing Street flat;
```
```
x 13 November 2020: a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a
special adviser;
```
```
x 17 December 2020: a gathering in Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall to hold an online
Christmas quiz for the Cabinet Secretary¶s private office;
```

```
x 17 December 2020: a gathering in Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall on the departure
of a senior Cabinet Office official and a No 10 official;
```
```
x 17 December 2020: a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of
two No 10 officials;
```
```
x 18 December 2020: a gathering in No 10 Downing Street ahead of the
Christmas break;
```
```
x 14 January 2021; a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of two
No 10 officials;
```
```
x 16 April 2021; A gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a senior
No 10 official;
```
```
x 16 April 2020; gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of another
No 10 official.
```
The Metropolitan Police assessed that the following gatherings did not reach the
threshold for criminal investigation:

```
x 15 May 2020: photograph showing a number of groups in the garden of No 10;
```
```
x 27 November 2020: a gathering in No 10 on the departure of a special adviser;
```
```
x 10 December 2020: a gathering in the Department for Education ahead of the
Christmas break;
```
```
x 15 December 2020: a gathering in No 10 for an online Christmas Quiz.
```
**Outcome of the Metropolitan Police investigation**

5. As I said in my 31 January update it was not for me to make a judgment on
    whether the criminal law had been broken: that is properly a matter for law
    enforcement bodies. Further to that on 19 May 2022 the Metropolitan Police
    announced that they had concluded their investigation. They confirmed that
    they had made 126 referrals for Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) to the ACRO
    Criminal Records Office for breaches of Covid-19 regulations in relation to
    events on the following eight dates:

```
x 20 May 2020
x 18 June 2020
x 19 June 2 020
```

```
x 13 November 2020
x 17 December 2020
x 18 December 2020
x 14 January 2021
x 16 April 2021
```
6. They did not specify to whom or in relation to which events those FPNs were
    issued, nor have they shared that information with me. They did confirm that a
    total of 83 individuals received FPNs and that some people received more than
    one. In order to refer for an FPN, officers were required to have a reasonable
    belief that the individual had committed an offence under the regulations.
7. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor each confirmed that they had received
    an FPN in relation to the event on the 19th June 2020. The Cabinet Secretary
    and Head of the Civil Service confirmed that he has not received an FPN.
8. Now that the police have concluded their enquiries I am able to set out in more
    detail, and in line with my terms of reference, my findings with respect to the
    gatherings within the scope of my investigation.

**Methodology**

9. My update set out the context and methodology of the investigation. I will not
    repeat that here other than to add some further detail relevant to the findings in
    this report.
_10._ In finalising this report I have continued to take advice, as appropriate from the
    Treasury Solicitor; Daniel Stilitz QC; and Christopher Knight of counsel.

_Scope_

11. The original scope of the Cabinet Office investigation focused on three
    gatherings alleged to have taken place in No 10 Downing Street and the
    Department for Education in November and December 2020. The terms of
    reference also allowed for the investigation of credible allegations of other
    gatherings. That led to my team and I investigating a further 13 events reported
    to have taken place in No 10 and the Cabinet Office during the period of the
    pandemic.
12. Details of these additional events emerged in a number of ways. In some
    instances information was proactively provided by the individuals we
    interviewed and throughout the process people were encouraged and reminded
    in line with the terms of reference, to provide any relevant information to the


```
Cabinet Office investigation team. I appreciate the events in question took place
some time ago and in very different circumstances. I also accept that memories
may have faded and that recollections will differ. I am very grateful to those who
sought to provide as much information as possible in what I realise may have
been a daunting experience given the public profile of this investigation. It was
also unfortunately the case that details of some events only became known to
me and my team through reporting in the media. This is disappointing. Given
the piecemeal manner in which events were brought to my attention, it is
possible that events took place which were not the subject of investigation.
However, my general findings and conclusions would equally apply.
```
_Nature of investigation and findings_

13. As I explained in my 31 January update, I did not seek to alter the terms of
    reference or the approach to the investigation when I took over from the Cabinet
    Secretary. My task was to establish a general understanding of the nature of
    the gatherings in scope. This was not intended to be an exhaustive process;
    nor was its purpose to determine individual wrongdoing or to produce a
    definitive, line by line narrative of each event. Rather the objective was to
    establish the broad facts of what took place at these gatherings, taking into
    account that some took place nearly two years ago.
14. Given the terms of reference, as well as the significant extension to the scope
    of the investigation, it was not possible to interview all of those who may have
    attended each of these events, nor was it necessary. As such the investigation
    focused on speaking with those individuals who were key to understanding
    whether the alleged events had taken place, and where they had, their nature,
    purpose and how they came to be organised.
15. In line with that approach what follows is a narrative account of how these
    events came about and what happened when they took place, as far as I have
    been able to establish. To support these accounts I have included, wherever
    appropriate, relevant factual documentary evidence including email invitations;
    photographs; and communications between staff that help in understanding the
    nature and purpose of the event, including any preparations which may have
    taken place.
16. There are of course differences in the level of detail in each of the narratives;
    the amount of evidence my team and I gathered varied by event. In some cases,
    we were able to obtain accounts from multiple attendees, as well as
    documentary material, including email communications, entry and exit logs and
    photographs. For other events there was less documentary evidence and we
    were only able to speak with a limited number of individuals. This was most
    notably the case for those events that we started investigating later in the


```
process, essentially at the point at which the Metropolitan Police said they
would be investigating those same events. This necessarily limited what we
were able to establish about those gatherings as it would not have been
appropriate to continue with our investigation once the police investigation had
commenced. The Metropolitan Police investigation had primacy. I have taken
the view that it would not be necessary, appropriate or proportionate to
undertake any further investigation work following the conclusion of the work of
the Metropolitan Police.
```
17. At their request, I provided the Metropolitan Police with the material compiled
    in the course of my investigation relevant to the dates they were investigating.
    However, to be clear the police investigation was entirely separate from the
    process I conducted.

_Naming_

18. This brings me to the question of names. This has not been easy. It is well
    established convention that the names of senior civil servants are not routinely
    withheld in Government disclosures. I have broadly followed this convention
    here, but given the unique circumstances of this investigation I have decided
    that naming should be only for the most high-ranking individuals who knew
    about and/or attended an event, as well as those senior civil servants or special
    advisers who were significant to the organisation of such gatherings, given their
    wider responsibility for the leadership and culture of the Departments, subject
    to some limited exceptions based on personal circumstances. I have
    determined that the public interest in reporting adequately on the events withing
    the scope of my investigation in accordance with my terms of reference justifies
    naming senior individuals involved to this limited extent.
19. It does not follow that any of those I have referred to in this report, named or
    otherwise have received an FPN, or that any inference or assumption can be
    made about the outcome of the police investigation in any individual case. As
    I have set out above, I have not been informed by the Metropolitan Police of
    these matters.

_Photographs_

20. My team and I have been provided with photographs of some of the events that
    took place, some official and others taken on personal devices. I have
    considered whether any of these should be published. I concluded that the
    official photographs should be within scope for disclosure only where they are
    particularly pertinent in helping to understand the nature and purpose of a
    gathering. I have attached these to this report. I have limited identification of
    individuals in the photographs to Ministers and the Cabinet Secretary.


_Record keeping_

21. The Cabinet Office investigation has accumulated a body of material in the
    course of its work ± interviews, photographs and documents ± the vast majority
    of which naturally is not directly used in the narratives below. I have asked the
    Cabinet Office Knowledge and Information team to be the custodian of this
    material, together with my own records relating to this work, for preservation in
    the official record.

**Context**

22. The context I set out in my update remains key to this report and findings and
    for completeness I have repeated that summary here.
23. The outbreak and spread of SARs Covid-19 represented a global public health
    crisis without parallel in living memory. In the United Kingdom it had a seismic
    impact on every aspect of life in the country. In response, to help control the
    spread of the virus and to keep the most vulnerable safe, the UK Government
    put in place far reaching restrictions on citizens that had direct and material
    impact on their lives, livelihood and liberties.
24. From 26 March 2020 the law in England required everyone to remain in their
    homes unless certain, very limited, exemptions applied. Restrictions were
    temporarily eased over the summer period in 2020 until most remaining national
    restrictions were removed on 4 July 2020. Restrictions were then reintroduced
    in gradations in the autumn culminating in the UK Government announcing from
    5 November 2020 restrictions on movements and gatherings in England,
    essentially requiring people to stay at home. Restrictions on gatherings of two
    or more people applied in London through December 2020 and the first months
    of 2021. Indoor mixing of two or more households was not permitted again until
    17 May 2021.
25. In line with those rules the vast majority of staff in Government Departments
    worked from home. The Civil Service, along with the rest of the public sector,
    went to great lengths to reconfigure the provision and delivery of public services
    and support for businesses almost overnight. Many private sector businesses
    and other organisations, large and small, all over the UK, were also working
    hard to deal with the pandemic both in terms of managing their businesses,
    their livelihoods and those of their employees, as well as providing vital support
    to the national effort to respond to the virus.
26. A small number of Government officials and special advisers, because of the
    nature of their jobs directly supporting the Prime Minister and other Ministers,


```
continued to attend their offices for the purposes of work, as permitted by an
exemption under the regulations.
```
27. In particular, No 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Office were at the centre
    of the Government¶s response to the pandemic. Tight knit groups of officials
    and advisers worked long hours under difficult conditions in buildings that could
    not be easily adapted as Covid secure workplaces. No 10 Downing Street and
    the Cabinet Office in 70 Whitehall are closely interconnected, with staff moving
    regularly between the two buildings as part of their daily work. The Prime
    Minister¶s flat and the Downing Street garden are in close proximity to the
    offices and serve a dual office and private purpose.
28. Those challenges, however, also applied to key and frontline workers across
    the country who were working under equally, if not more, demanding conditions,
    often at risk to their own health. It is important to remember the stringency of
    the public health regulations in force in England over the relevant periods and
    that criminal sanctions were applied to many found to be in breach of them. The
    hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even
    died while observing the Government¶s regulations and guidance rigorously are
    known only too well.
29. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. Everyone has made
    personal sacrifices, some the most profound, having been unable to be with
    loved ones in their last moments or care for vulnerable family and friends.

**Factual findings of the events**

30. For each event, I have summarised the particularly relevant passages of the
    applicable regulations and Government guidance. As explained in my update
    report, it is not my role to make a judgment on whether or not the criminal law
    has been broken; my focus has been on establishing the nature and purpose
    of the events and whether those events were appropriate in light of the
    Government¶s own guidance. Where I have set out the terms of the regulations,
    this is because they also formed part of the guidance. Other aspects of the
    guidance, particularly in relation to social distancing, were in addition to the
    terms of the regulations.
31. The numerical references attributed to roles are distinct for each event.
32. On the evidence collected, I have made the following findings:


**15 May 2020; a photograph showing a number of groups in the garden of No
10 Downing Street**

**Extracts of regulations and guidance**

_On 26 March 2020 restrictions on leaving one¶s home Zithout a reasonable e[cuse,
first announced on 23 March, came into legal effect in England. Very limited
justifications permitted travel to work where it was not reasonably possible to work
from home. Participating in a gathering of more than two persons in public was
prohibited e[cept Zhere the gathering Zas ³essential for Zork purposes ́._

_On 13 May 2020 some restrictions were relaxed to allow meetings outdoors for
exercise or recreation with one person from another household. Guidance
encouraged those who could not work from home to go back to work. At work,
social distancing guidance applied, Zith Zorkplaces required ³to maintain 2m social
distancing wherever possible, including while arriving at and departing from work,
while in work and when travelling betZeen sites ́. Leaving or being outside one¶s
home without a reasonable excuse continued to be prohibited._

**The event**

On 15 May 2020 in the early evening a number of people gathered in the No 10
garden. The individuals were divided into groups of varying sizes, with some
standing on the grass and two other groups seated at tables on the terrace. A
photograph of these groups was subsequently published in the Guardian
newspaper on 19 December 2021. As explained by those interviewed as part of
the investigation, this gathering was actually a number of separate meetings.

The largest group pictured was made up of the then Secretary of State for Health
and Social Care, No 10 and DHSC officials and special advisers who had convened
at around 18.00 following a press conference which had just taken place in
Downing Street. Wine is visible on the table and some individuals drank alcohol.
Two other No 10 officials are pictured separately on the grass. Both groups were
discussing the press conference. The Secretary of State left at approximately
18.25.

At a table on the terrace, the Prime Minister, Martin Reynolds (his Principal Private
Secretary), and Dominic Cummings (his senior adviser) were continuing a lengthy
meeting that had started in the Prime Minister¶s office, before moving to the garden
at around 18.00. The Prime Minister brought cheese and wine from his flat. The
outdoor part of the meeting lasted for 40 minutes to an hour and they were briefly
joined by the Prime Minister¶s wife, during which time the photograph was taken.
Martin Reynolds subsequently returned to the office to continue working. The
Prime Minister remained in the garden until around 19.20.


There is a further group of four individuals sitting at a table on the terrace. It has
not been possible to identify these individuals, but there is no reason to suggest
that this was anything other than a further work meeting.

**Summary**

On 20 May 2020 there was a gathering in the No 1 0 garden. The investigation was
told that the event was for the purposes of boosting staff morale following a
challenging period for staff. The invitation for the event was made initially to No 10
staff and was then extended to other individuals and teams in the Cabinet Office.
It was an event planned in advance by officials and attended by a significant
number of people. Some concerns were expressed about whether it was
appropriate to hold the event.

**Preparations**

On 13 May 2020 at 14.53 a No 10 official (³No 10 Official 1 ́) sent an email to the
No 10 Private Secretary email group and to a special adviser. It read:

_³Hi all,_

_It¶s meant to be nice Zeather ne[t Zeek so shall Ze tr\ to do a sociall\ distanced
drinks in the garden on Wednesday or Thursday?_


_[No 10 Official (2)] let¶s chat about arranging it._

_We can open it up to an\one else Zho is in the House on that da\. ́_

On 14 May 2020 at 13.13 No 10 official (2) contacted the Internal Events team to
book the garden for the following week stating that μ[ _No 10 Official (1) and [No 10
Official (2)] will go out and get the booze_ ¶. A member of the internal events team
replied on 15 May 2020 and said μ... _.Sounds like lots of fun«That¶s fine. Just a
reminder about the press conference so just be courteous with sound from 4-6pm_ ¶.

On 18 May 2020 at 12.48 No 10 Official (2) wrote to No 10 Facilities Management
saying:

³ _Could you please pop out a couple of tables for us to host these drinks in the
garden on Weds evening from around 5 to 7? It is for Private Office and then
Zhoever is in the House on the da\. ́_

On 20 May 2020 at 11.34, a scheduler was sent by email on behalf of Martin
Reynolds, the Prime Minister¶s Principal Private Secretary, to a number of
individuals in the Private Office and to a number of special advisers in No 10.

-----Original Appointment-----
**From:** _[No 10 OFFICIAL (2)]_ **On Behalf Of** _[MARTIN REYNOLDS]_
**Sent:** 20 May 2020 11:
**To:** _[26 No 10 Staff]]_
**Subject:** Socially distanced drinks
**When:** 20 May 2020 17:30-19:30 (UTC+00:00) Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon,
London.
**Where:** No10 Garden

Following the scheduler No 10 Official (2) sent an email at 12.46 to the office of the
then Cabinet Secretary saying μ.. _.we are having some socially distanced drinks in
the garden later and wanted to invite whoever is in your office. They start at 6 -
would you be able to pass on the message to those in today please? Strictly your
office though so Ze don¶t end up Zith lots of people!_ ¶. A member of staff in the
Cabinet Secretary¶s office replied μ. _...I have let those in the office know. I think there
are 4 in today_ ....¶ No 10 Official (2) responded μ _Great! Could you also suggest they
bring their oZn boo]e! Not sure Ze Zill have enough but hopefull\ there aren¶t that
man\ people in the building!¶_

As a follow up to the scheduler a draft email setting out a written invitation to the
gathering on 20 May 2020 was sent by No 10 Official (2) at 13.08 to Martin
Reynolds for approval and copied to No 10 Official (1). Martin Reynolds replied
μ _That is great ± please issue¶_. No 10 Official (1) sent an email saying μ _Looks good._


_I think send it to relevant teams. The Everyone email goes very wide (protection
team etc)¶_. The email invitation was subsequently issued on behalf of Martin
Reynolds at 13.44 with a further copy of the scheduler. The email said:

_³Hi all,_

_After what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make
the most of this lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the
garden this evening._

_Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!_

_Martin. ́_

The email invitation was sent to a number of group distribution lists, as well as
individuals, comprising in total around 200 staff across No 10 Downing Street. The
invitation was also sent to special advisers in the Chancellor¶s office and a member
of staff in the No 10 Covid-19 Coordination unit. Martin Reynolds also sent a
separate email invitation to other senior officials.

Some of those who received the original invitation, as well those to whom it was
forwarded, accepted the scheduler itself or otherwise emailed to indicate that they
would be there.

A No 10 special adviser also forwarded the email at 13.56 onto a No 10 official
involved with the Covid Press conference which was taking place that day, saying:
μ _In case you & others in the office today want to join after the presser. (I will flag
separately to Martin that this will be around the time speakers and cameras are
leaving after the press conference and to be mindful of that)_ ¶. The No 10 official to
whom the email was sent replied to say μ _Thank \ou Zill share Zith the team here¶_
and subsequently forwarded the invitation to other members of the No 10 Events
& Visits team stating μ _FYI and if of interest, [No 10 special adviser] will flag with
Martin that the presser will be concluding around this time_ ¶.

Following the email, the same No 10 special adviser sent a message to Martin
Reynolds by WhatsApp at 14.08 stating μ _Drinks this eve is a lovel\ idea so I¶ve
shared with the E & V team who are in the office. Just to flag that the press
conference will probably be finishing around that time, so helpful if people can be
mindful of that as speakers and cameras are leaving, not walking around waving
bottles of Zine etc¶._ Martin Reynolds replied μ _Will do my best!_ ....¶

A No 10 Director declined the invitation and told the investigation that they had
raised with either Martin Reynolds or his office that it was not a good idea.


Lee Cain, the then No 10 Director of Communications (a special adviser), also
received the invitation. In response, he emailed Martin Reynolds, No 10 official (1),
and Dominic Cummings at 14.35 on 20 May 2020 stating: μ _I¶m sure it Zill be fine -
and I applaud the gesture - but a 200 odd person invitation for drinks in the garden
of no 10 is somewhat of a comms risk in the current environment._ ¶ Lee Cain says
he subsequently spoke to Martin Reynolds and advised him that the event should
be cancelled. Martin Reynolds does not recall any such conversation. In addition,
Dominic Cummings has also said that he too raised concerns, in writing. We have
not found any documentary evidence of this.

**The event**

The event itself began shortly before 18.00 on 20 May 2020. It has been difficult to
ascertain exact numbers in attendance, but it is likely that there were approximately
30 - 40 people in the garden. The Prime Minister attended at approximately 18.
for around 30 minutes to thank staff before returning to his office with Martin
Reynolds for a meeting at 18.30. This meeting lasted 30 minutes after which Martin
Reynolds returned to the garden for an unknown period. The Prime Minister did
not return to the garden. Lee Cain informed the investigation that he attended the
event for a brief period to ascertain who was present in the garden. A No 10 official
also informed the investigation that they had been out in the garden briefly at
approximately 18.00 and had noted a small number of individuals gathered. The
No 10 official spoke to another colleague who informed them that they were
attending for the drinks and on hearing this the No 10 official left. The majority of
people who attended the event were present early on in the evening with a number
of individuals leaving Downing Street between 22.00 and 23.00. Drinks and pizza
were provided and paid for by staff.

On the following day, the 21 May 2020, a No 10 special adviser emailed Martin
Reynolds saying:

_³Hi Martin,_

_Thank you so much for organising these drinks and for providing the wine! A very
kind thing to do and I knoZ ever\one reall\ appreciated it. ́_

Martin Reynolds replied:

_³Thanks ± it was lots of fun and nice to chat Zith ever\one. ́_

This event was also referenced in a subsequent Whatsapp message on an
unknown date from Martin Reynolds to a special adviser:


_[Martin Re\nolds] [19:36] ³Best of luck ± a complete non story but better than them
focusing on our drinks (which we seem to have got away with)._ ́

**18 June 2020: a gathering in the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall on the departure
of a No 10 official**

**Extract of regulations and guidance**

_On 1 June 2020, England moved to ³step 2 ́ of the Government¶s roadmap in Zhich
restrictions on leaving one¶s home Zere removed. Gatherings of tZo or more
persons indoors and more than six outdoors were prohibited. An exception
permitted gatherings that are ³reasonabl\ necessar\ «. for Zork purposes ́. At
work, social distancing guidance continued to say ³you must maintain social
distancing in the Zork place Zherever possible. ́ Work places Zere required ³to
maintain 2m social distancing wherever possible, including when arriving at and
departing from work, Zhile in Zork, and Zhen travelling betZeen sites ́._

_On 13 June 2020 individual prayer in places of worship was allowed again and on
15 June 2020 non-essential retail businesses were permitted to re-open._

**Summary**

On the 18 June 2020 a gathering took place in No 10 and in the Cabinet Office at
70 Whitehall, to mark the departure of a No 10 official (³No 10 official (1) ́). The first
part of the event took place in No 10 in the Cabinet Room involving formal leaving
speeches and some alcohol. This lasted approximately for up to an hour. The
second part took place in 70 Whitehall in the Cabinet Secretary¶s rooms with
alcohol, food and music.

**Preparations**

On 11 June 2020, an email invitation was sent at 18.12 by No 10 official (1) to the
Private Secretaries in No 10 inviting them to an event to mark their departure. The
email was entitled μ _No 10 official (1) leaving drinks_ ¶. These were scheduled to take
place on 18 June 2020, from 6-9pm, in a location that was μ _TBC_ ¶. At 19.12 No 10
official (1) sent an identical invitation to a number of other individuals in No 10
including senior officials and special advisers which was called μ _No 10 official (1)
leaving drinks_ ¶.

A number of individuals accepted the invitation.

There was some internal discussion about the event between Martin Reynolds,
Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, and Lee Cain, the No 10 Director


of Communications. On 12 June there was an exchange of WhatsApp messages
between the two that read:

_[Martin Re\nolds] [18:31] ³No 10 official (1)¶s leaving drinks next week - can we
discuss handling! ́
[Lee Cain] [18:32] ³Yes - not sure hoZ Ze do it but Zant to do something ́
[Martin Re\nolds] [19:01] ³Is it safer to do a larger event indoors but Zith some
people carr\ing on outside afterZards? ́
[Lee Cain] [19:20] ³I¶m not sure it Zorks at all to be honest, Zhich Zould be a
shame. I don¶t see hoZ Ze can have some kind of part\ though ́
[Martin Re\nolds] [19:23] ³So \ou are sa\ing nothing for [No 10 official (1)]? ́
[Lee Cain [18:32] ³I think it¶s \our decision m\ friend, not mind [sic]! But it obviousl\
comes Zith rather substantial comms risks ́_

On 17 June 2020 there were email exchanges between No 10 official (1) and a
second No 10 official (No 10 official (2)), (subject matter μ _My Leaving_ ¶) regarding
the logistics of the event.

No 10 official (1) emailed No 10 official (2) and another No 10 official (No 10 official
(3)) stating:

_³Hi It would be nice to do the speech bit either tomorrow or Friday with a zoom
option so I can invite a wider No 10 audience (i.e. Questions, R&I, speechwriters
DCs, PU, press, media spads, covid lot, political team etc)««« ́_

No 10 official (2) replied to stating:

³ _Hi Martin [Reynolds] and Stuart [Glassborow] would like to do speeches tomorrow
Zhen Ze have \our drinks Zhich aren¶t drinks. What time are we planning on the
drinks? I think we should aim to do speeches in the Cabinet Room via Zoom after
6.30 Zhen the PM has gone and Dom¶s evening meeting has finished. What shall
I call the invite? I will get the Zoom details at some point tomorroZ ́_.

No 10 official (1) replied _μWell if Ze¶re doing it in Cabinet Room Zith a gap then to
the actual drinks, I think we can more explicitly call it [No 10 official (1)] goodbye or
leaving speech, or something?¶._

No 10 official (2) replied μ _Is 6.30 ok for this? We could maybe squeeze it in at 1730
but might have to be a different room! Zoom details below._

_Topic: No 10 official (1) Goodbye
Time: Jun 18, 2020 0630 pm London_

_[Zoom meeting details]¶_


No 10 official (1) said that ahead of the event taking place they recalled seeking
prior permission from senior officials to use the Cabinet Secretary¶s offices for their
drinks following speeches in the Cabinet Room.

**The first part of the event**

On 18 June 2020 over 25 people gathered for the first formal part of the leaving
event with speeches which took place in the Cabinet Room, including No 10 official
(1), Dominic Cummings and Simon Case, the Permanent Secretary for Covid and
the Pandemic Response in No 10. It began, approximately, between 18.30 to 19.
and finished before 19.40. Not all those who attended in person stayed for the
entirety of this period. Others dialled into the event virtually by Zoom. Alcohol was
available and Stuart Glassborow, Deputy Principal Private Secretary to the Prime
Minister, gave a speech.

**The second part of the event**

The second phase of the event took place from around 19.40 in the μWaiting Room¶
area outside the Cabinet Secretary¶s private office in 70 Whitehall and not all
attendees from the first part attended the second part.

At around 19.40, at the conclusion of the event in the Cabinet Room a number of
staff moved through from No 10 into 70 Whitehall using the link door between the
two buildings. Those individuals went into the Cabinet Secretary¶s Waiting Room.

There was an exchange of messages on a No 10 Private Office WhatsApp group,
which read:

_[No 10 official (4)] [19:40] ³Where is ever\one? ́
[No 10 official (4) ] [19:41] ³The pi]]as are here. ́
[No 10 official (1)] [19:43] ³We¶re moving to cab sec office ́
[No 10 official (1)] [19:47] ³We¶re in outer office of cab sec Zith pi]]a ́_

The link door log shows that a number of officials from the No 10 Private Office
went through the link door between 19.51 and 20.16 including Martin Reynolds and
Stuart Glassborow. They joined the other members of the Private Office, including
No 10 official (1), already in the waiting room. Some brought pizza and prosecco
and they were followed by others, over the next couple of hours. Helen
MacNamara, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, attended for part of the evening and
provided a karaoke machine which was set up in an adjoining office to the waiting
room.


The Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, returned from a meeting and noted that
there were individuals in his waiting room. He stayed for a short time and before
leaving for another meeting he gave permission for the use of his office for a short
time.

The event lasted for a number of hours. There was excessive alcohol consumption
by some individuals. One individual was sick. There was a minor altercation
between two other individuals.

The event broke up in stages with a few members of staff leaving from around
21.00 and the last member of staff, who stayed to tidy up, leaving at 03.13.

**Summary**

On 19 June 2020 a number of individuals gathered in the Cabinet Room in No 10
Downing Street to wish the Prime Minister a happy birthday. Food, alcohol and soft
drinks were provided, having been organised in advance that morning. The event
lasted around 20- 30 minutes.

**Preparations**

On the morning of 19 June 2020, Cleo Watson, a No 10 special adviser who
informed the investigation that she had been asked to organise the event, had an
exchange of Whatsapp messages with Martin Reynolds, Principal Private
Secretary to the Prime Minister messages as follows:


_[Cleo Watson] [09:09] ³Hi! PM birthda\ toda\ - Ze¶ve organised some sandZiches
and cake for about 1pm in the Cabinet Room if anyone from your team would like
to pop in and wish him a happy birthda\«. ́
[Cleo Watson] [09:09] ³Have sent this to polic\, press and e&v heads. Do \ou mind
letting PSs knoZ? ́
[Martin Re\nolds] [09:32] ³Will do ́._

Martin Reynolds subsequently sent an email at 09.34 to a number of No10 staff,
including the No 10 Permanent Secretary for Covid and the Pandemic Response,
Simon Case, and the No 10 Private Secretaries, saying μ _For the PM¶s birthda\
today we are having sandwiches and cake in the Cabinet room so do come along
and wish the PM happy birthday._ ¶ We do not know which individuals saw this email.

**The event**

The Prime Minister was not aware of this event in advance and it did not form part
of his official diary for the day. He returned from an external visit to No 10 Downing
Street at approximately 14.20 and was taken into the Cabinet Room which had
been set up with sandwiches, snacks, soft drinks and cans of beer. Those attending
included No 10 officials and Mrs. Johnson. The Permanent Secretary for Covid and
Pandemic Response, Simon Case, attended for a short period having arrived early
for a meeting which was due to take place in the Cabinet room. The Chancellor
was also there briefly having also arrived early for the same meeting. He had no
advance knowledge about what had been planned.

The event lasted between 14.25 and 14.45, throughout which the Prime Minister
was present. Those attending consumed food and drink, and some drank alcohol.
There are photographs of the event.

**Extract from regulations/guidance**

_On 5 November 2020, a second national lockdown was introduced which required
people to stay at home and prohibited indoor gatherings of two or more people
from other households except for permitted exceptions, including where the

**Summary**

On 13 November 2020 it was publicly announced that two of the Prime Minister¶s
most senior advisers, Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain, would leave government.
There was a leaving speech and drinks in No 10 for Lee Cain later that day, which
the Prime Minister attended.

**The event**

A number of press office staff and media special advisers gathered in the Press
Office area of No 10 to mark the departure of Lee Cain, the No 10 Director of
Communications. The investigation was informed that this was not pre-planned. It
did occur at around the time that μWine Time Friday¶ would normally be taking
place. The Prime Minister attended on his way to his Downing Street flat, having
left his office at 19.17. He went to the Press Office area, joined the gathering and
made a leaving speech for Lee Cain. Wine had been provided and those attending,
including the Prime Minister, were drinking alcohol. There are a number of
photographs of the event.

**A gathering in the No 10 Downing Street flat**

**The event**

Following the announcement of the departure of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain,
a meeting was held in the No 1 0 flat from some time after 18.00 to discuss the
handling of their departure. Five special advisers attended. The Prime Minister
joined them at about 20.00. Food and alcohol were available. The discussion
carried on later into the evening with attendees leaving at various points.

The information collected on this gathering is limited as the process of obtaining
evidence had only just been commenced when the Metropolitan Police announced
their own investigations, which included events on the 13 November 2020. At this
point I stopped my investigation, given the need to avoid any prejudice to the police
investigation. Following the Metropolitan Police announcement on 19 May 2022 I
considered whether or not to conduct any further investigation into this event but
concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to do so.

**Summary**

On 27 November 2020 a number of people gathered in the No 10 Press Office area
to say goodbye to a special adviser, who was leaving government. Officials,
including senior officials, and special advisers were present. The Prime Minister
attended and gave a short leaving speech.

**The event**

On 27 November 2020 **,** a No 10 special advisor left government having said
goodbye to a number of people at their desks during that day and decided to visit
the No 10 Press Office to say goodbye to the staff who worked there. This took
place at approximately 18.00 on a Friday evening.

It appears to have been an impromptu gathering. An exchange of messages took
place between the No 10 special adviser and a No 10 official. At 17.46 the No 10
official asked _³Were [sic] Zill \ou be in 20 minutes? ́_ At 17.58 the special adviser
replied _³Press Room! ́_ and, at 18:00 sent a further message to the No 10 official
saying, _³Will \ou let PS folks knoZ?¶._ The No 10 official replied at 18.06 stating
_μYes¶._ At 18.19 the No 10 official sent a further message saying _μWe are coming
noZ¶._

There were approximately 15 to 20 people in attendance, some of whom were
drinking alcohol. As well as some people from the Press Office, a number of senior
officials, private office staff and special advisers attended the event.

The Prime Minister finished a meeting at 18.19 and then attended the Press Office
to say goodbye. He remained for a short time, saying a few words of thanks and


farewell, before returning to his office for his next meeting which was scheduled for
18.45. The special adviser left the building by 18.58.

**Summary**

On 10 December 2020 a gathering took place in the Department for Education.
The Secretary of State for Education wanted to thank staff for their hard work ahead
of the Christmas break. Senior officials and special advisers attended the event.
There was food and alcohol available and it lasted for around an hour.

**Preparations**

In early December 2020 planning began in the Department for Education for an
event to thank members of staff who had been working in the office during the
pandemic. This was discussed between senior officials in the Department and the
Secretary of State, who asked members of his Private Office to make the
arrangements. Initially, the intention was to hold the event in the Private Office
working area, but officials subsequently decided to move the event to the


Department¶s canteen on the basis that it is a well-ventilated space that would
permit easier social distancing.

On 7 December 2020 at 15.52 an email was sent from the Secretary of State¶s
Private Office internally within the Department for Education, inviting approximately
50 staff including Private Office officials, departmental officials and special advisers
to μ³ _socially distanced_ ́ festive drinks.

_³Hi all,_

_We¶re planning on having some μsociall\ distanced¶ festive drinks in the canteen
on Thursday. It would be great if you could join us. This is open to Private Office
staff and ministers if the\ are around««
For those Zorking at home«there are plans for a Christmas Divisional Zhere
people Zill be able to dial in and have a Virtual Festive gathering«. ́_

**The event**

Approximately 20-30 staff gathered in the canteen at around 17.00 on 10
December 2020. Staff had been invited to bring their own refreshments, including
a suggestion in the invitation that those joining should bring their own bottle. At the
event there was wine, some of which, along with mince pies, was provided by the
Secretary of State and his Private Office.

The Secretary of State thanked staff at the event, leaving shortly afterwards to
travel back to his constituency. Some people remained in the canteen for a short
period. The event lasted around 60 minutes.

**Summary**

On 15 December 2020 a virtual quiz took place for No 10 staff. This was attended
by No 10 staff who were present in Downing Street and 70 Whitehall and by some
who joined from home. Alcohol and food was available in Downing Street and at
70 Whitehall, supplied and paid for by staff attending. The quiz and prize-giving
lasted approximately three and a half hours.

**Preparations**

On 27 November 2020 at 13.50, an email invitation was sent by the No 10 People
& Wellbeing Group (³PWG ́) to all No 10 staff inviting them to a virtual Christmas
Quiz on Tuesday 15 December 2020. The email read:

_³As Ze are not able to get together this \ear for a Christmas part\ the People and
Wellbeing group have arranged a Christmas Quiz on Tuesday 15th December from

_Dress up for the festive season and get \our cameras on! «.._

_«Further details Zill folloZ shortl\, if \ou Zant to get involved please email the
PWG inbo[. ́_

On 11 December 2020, a further email was sent by the PWG, again to all No 10
staff, setting out the joining instructions and running order for the quiz and the need
to follow social distancing guidance. Participants were organised into teams of six
and were invited to join virtually in one of three ways: (i) from home, (ii) from their
desk in No 10 Downing Street, (iii) from meeting rooms in No 10 or 70 Whitehall
(where some No 10 staff members were based). This email included the following:

_³The Quiz will take place on Tuesday 15th at 1800 ± 2000 « We need to be mindful
of Hands-Face-Space!_


_The expectation is that this is a virtual quiz._ **_Please do not come into the office
on Tuesday for the quiz, if you are not due to be working from the office._** _For
those who are working in No 10 and planning to stay in the office for the quiz,
please ensure you are following social distancing rules already set out in No10.
Teams in the office should ensure that they arrange themselves behind the
Perspex screens. All staff will be required to leave the office immediately after the
end of the quiz_

_[No 10 official] Zill be presenting the main qui] via MS Teams from the Stud\«\ou
will then need to ensure you arrange a zoom call or other method so you can
discuss ansZers Zith \our team««. ́_

The invitation email included details of the proposed teams and running order. It
was scheduled to start at 18.00 and end at 20.30, followed by results and prizes
between 20.30 to 20.45. Departure from No 10 for those present in the offices was
scheduled between 20.45 and 21.30.

**The event**

On 15 December 2020, the planned quiz began at around 18.00. Approximately
120 - 150 staff joined, some from home and others based in rooms across No 10
Downing Street and 70 Whitehall. At least 18 members of No 10 staff joined from
a large room in 70 Whitehall.

The Prime Minister joined the quiz at approximately 19.50 to read out the questions
to one of the rounds. This had been agreed in principle in advance and was
confirmed on the day. This is not unusual, he was frequently called upon by his
office to attend staff events. He remained at the event for 12 minutes before
returning to his office. There are published photographs of his participation in the
event.

Food and alcohol was available during the quiz which was purchased by individuals
on behalf of their teams. Some teams in the office gathered close together around
laptop screens.

Some staff drank alcohol. A No 10 official sent a message on internal No 10
systems referring to _μdrunkenness¶_ and advising staff to leave No 10 via the back
exit. The No 10 official informed the investigation team that they did this in order to
avoid staff being photographed by the press outside.

The quiz finished at approximately 21.30. Most of those in the office in No 10 either
left or returned to work after the quiz with some remaining continuing to chat and
some drank alcohol.


**17 December 2020:**

**A gathering in Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall to hold an online Christmas quiz
for the Cabinet Secretary¶s Private Office**

**Summary**

On 17 December 2020 a virtual quiz took place in the Cabinet Secretary¶s Private
Office for staff who were in the office and working at home that day. Alcohol and
food were consumed during the quiz which lasted approximately 90 minutes in
total.

**The event**

On 1 December 2020 an email was sent by a Cabinet Office official in the Cabinet
Secretary¶s Private Office to fellow Private Office staff (comprising 12 individuals)
inviting them to a μ _virtual Christmas party_ ¶ that would be held on Thursday 17
December 2020. The invitation said:


_³Hi Team,_

_Having consulted the leave tracker Ze¶re planning to have our virtual Christmas
Party on Thursday 17th December ± if anyone has any major objections to that date
please could you let us know today?_

_Also please do flag b\ COP if \ou Zouldn¶t like to be part of secret santa«.. ́_

The event was discussed in advance, including the idea of a virtual quiz, with senior
officials in the Cabinet Secretary¶s office. They had agreed that it could go ahead
on the understanding that the team¶s rota system, which had been set up to assist
with social distancing, was observed. This meant that half of the Private Office
team would be in the office and the other half would be working at home on any
given day.

On 17 December 2020 the virtual quiz took place in the outer office of the Cabinet
Secretary¶s room. It began at approximately 17.30. There were approximately five
people in the office that day. The Cabinet Secretary was not present for the quiz.
Those in the office joined by sitting at their desks using a large communal video
screen with microphone and speakers in the outer office area. Others joined online.
There was some food and alcohol available, which had been bought that day by a
member of the office.

The quiz itself lasted around an hour. Once it had finished, an online game of
³Articulate ́ was played by those in the office and those at home. This game lasted
around half an hour. The event finished at around 19.00.

Once the game of ³Articulate ́ had finished, there was some informal chat for a brief
period between those joining remotely and the group in the office. The virtual
participants then logged off. Those who had been working in the office continued
to chat.

At 20.25 the Cabinet Secretary returned to his office from No 10 and remained
working there. Before leaving the building at 21.45 he stopped to speak to
members of his Private Office for about 15 minutes. He was offered and took a
beer. His Private Office team remained in the office chatting and finishing their
drinks and snacks.


**A gathering in No 10 on the departure of two No 10 Officials**

**Summary**

On 17 December 2020 a leaving event for two No 10 Officials (³No 10 Officials ( 1 )
and (2) ́) took place in No 10 in the Pillared Room. There were speeches, including
from the Prime Minister and senior officials, and alcohol. Approximately 20 people
attended.

**Preparations**

On 8 December 2020, at 11.59, a third No 10 Private Office official (³No 10 Official
(3) ́), sent a meeting invitation to No 10 Private Secretaries, the Director of
Communications, Head of the Press Office, and other individuals in the Press and
Private Offices of No 10. The meeting was titled μPO Meeting and farewells¶ and
scheduled for 17 December 18. 30 - 21 .00 in the Pillared Room of No 10. The
farewells were for No 10 Officials (1) and (2).

On 14 December at 17.03, No 10 Official (3) sent a further email to the original
invitee list and extended the invitation to other officials in No 10, including senior
officials, the Events & Visits Team, and the Foreign Press Team. The invitation
was entitled: _[No 10 Official ( 1 )] - Moving on¶¶_

On 17 December 2020, a fourth No 10 official arranged for the Pillared Room to be
prepared for the event, asking No 10 Facilities Management: μ _Would it be possible
for the tables in the [Pillared Room] to be cleared out and left with just one table
ahead of a Private Office farewell for [No 10 Official ( 1 )] at 1800 please?_ ¶.

**The event**

The event began at approximately 18.00 as a work-related meeting to discuss how
the office would run over the Christmas break. At approximately 19.00, formal
leaving speeches began for No 10 Officials ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). There were around 20
people in the room from across No 10 but predominantly from the Private Office
staff. Other members of staff joined virtually. Approximately five bottles of wine
were provided for those attending.

The Prime Minister attended for around 15 minutes from 19.50 to 20.05, giving a
speech thanking both No 10 Officials ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) before returning to his office for
further meetings. There were also speeches by other officials.

Following the speeches, those who had joined the event virtually left the meeting.
Several of those in the room also left at this point, some others remained for a
period of around 45 minutes before heading home or returning to their offices to


work. A small number of individuals (three or four) remained in the Pillared Room
for a while longer and then went to the Private Office area, where they continued
to drink alcohol until approximately 01.00.

The No 10 link door entry/exit logs show that between 00.43 and 00.49 six
members of staff from the Cabinet Office (some of whom had left the separate
leaving event set out below of officials from the Covid Taskforce) went into No 10
and joined those remaining No 10 staff who were still gathered. The two groups
met in the Private Office briefly before parting ways. No 10 and Cabinet Office door
logs show them all leaving No 10 and Cabinet Office between 01 .10 and 01 .28.

**A gathering in Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall on the departure of a Senior
Cabinet Office Official and a No 10 Official**

**Summary**

On 17 December 2020 a leaving event took place for Kate Josephs, a Director
General in the Covid Task force, and an official from No 10. The event took place
in the Cabinet Office in 70 Whitehall and was attended by 20 to 30 officials,
including senior officials, from No 10 and the Cabinet Office.

**Preparations**

Kate Josephs and a No 10 official were leaving the Civil Service and wished to
mark their departure with a formal leaving event. In the week before the event there
was a discussion with the Second Permanent Secretary, James Bowler, about the
planned event. He said that it could take place on the basis that it was time limited,
that no one was to travel into the office specially and that it should be socially
distanced. The Cabinet Office Covid Taskforce operated largely on a work from
home basis with the exception of some key staff, mostly senior civil servants who
attended the office in 70 Whitehall. On a typical day, there were approximately
twelve members of staff present.

On 16 December 2020, an updated invitation was sent at 10.54 by a Cabinet Office
official on behalf of Kate Josephs, from her email account, to 40 members of staff
from across the Cabinet Office and No 10. It invited them to an event in _μ70
Whitehall Conference Room C¶_ from 18. 30 - 20 .30 on 17 December 2020. The
invitation read:

_³Kate J and [No 10 official] farewell drinks @ Thu 17 Dec 2020 6:30pm - 8:30pm
Where: 70 Whitehall Conference Room C_

_Given higher COVID restrictions please do not travel into London for this if you
wouldn't otherwise have been in the office_


_We are leaving the COVID Taskforce :(_

_*given higher COVID restrictions please do not travel into London for this if you
Zouldn¶t otherZise have been in the office*._

_We'd love it if you could join us for a farewell, COVID secure, drink_

_Kate Josephs and [No 10 official] ́_

**The event**

The event began between 19.00 and 20.00 on 17 December 2020, with more than
20 staff attending, including James Bowler, Simon Ridley, one of the other Director
Generals of the Covid 19 Taskforce, and Kate Josephs. James Bowler gave a
leaving speech to thank both Kate Josephs and the No 10 official and returned to
his office to work shortly afterwards, before leaving the building at around 20.45.

The intention was to follow the social distancing guidance by observing a one way
system, social distancing and other precautionary measures. This did not happen
as those in the room gathered in small groups, and there was also mingling
between groups. There was food and drink available, including crisps, beer and
prosecco that had been purchased by individuals attending. Background music
was played through a smartphone. Some people left after the speeches.

The event began to wind down between 22.00 and 22.30. After 22.30 a smaller
group of 6-8 staff were left in the room. At least one member of staff went into No
10 to attend a separate event that evening (the leaving event for No 10 Officials ( 1 )
and (2) addressed above), before later returning to this event in the Cabinet Office.
At 22.44, an individual ordered six pizzas for the group.

The event ended at between 23.00 to 23.30, with most of those remaining,
including Simon Ridley, leaving at this point. Some others, including Kate Josephs,
left later at around 00.23 after tidying up.

A small number of individuals stayed beyond that. They joined with other members
of staff from elsewhere in the Cabinet Office and headed through the link door to
No 10, apparently with the intention of joining the separate leaving event taking
place for No 10 officials (1) and (2). No 10 exit/entry logs show that, between 00.43
and 00.49, six members of staff entered No 10 through the link door.


**18 December 2020: A gathering in No 10 Downing Street ahead of the
Christmas break**

**Extracts from regulations and guidance**

_On 5 November 2020, a second national lockdown was introduced which required
people to stay at home and prohibited indoor gatherings of two or more people
from other households except for permitted exceptions, including where the
³gathering is reasonabl\ necessar\ « for Zork purposes ́._

_On 2 December 2020, England was divided into three tiers, with London in Tier 2
in which gatherings of two or more people indoors continued to be prohibited unless
an exception applied, such as where the gathering was reasonably necessary for
work purposes. Government guidance, issued on 30 November 2020 for the
Christmas period, on visiting pubs and restaurants advised: ³although there are
exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party
where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules
in \our tier. ́_

_On 16 December 2020, London was moved to Tier 3. Indoor gatherings of two or
more people from different households continued to be prohibited. Social
distancing remained the rule at Zork, Zith offices advised ³to maintain social
distancing guidelines (2m, or 1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable),
wherever possible, including while arriving at and departing from work, while in
Zork and Zhen travelling betZeen sites ́. The Christmas part\ guidance issued on
the 30 November 2020 remained unchanged._

**Summary**

On 18 December 2020 a gathering lasting several hours took place in the No 10
Press Office. Between 20 and 45 individuals attended over the course of the
evening to celebrate the end of year and Christmas. The event included a Secret
Santa and an awards ceremony. There was alcohol and food.

**Preparations**

The investigation was told that members of the Press Office have, for some time
(including before the pandemic), brought in wine on Fridays to mark the end of the
week. This was known as μWine Time Friday¶ where bottles of wine were placed
on a table in a small room adjacent to the main Press Office and people could help
themselves. On Fridays senior officials would routinely recognise the efforts of staff
by handing out some awards and a small trophy cup to recognise weekly
achievements. The No 10 Press Office maintained almost full staff attendance in


the office during the pandemic, in order to carry out their roles effectively, with some
rota working for duty staff.

On 27 November 2020, a message was sent at 15.31 by a No 10 official on a
WhatsApp Group consisting of No 10 media special advisers and members of the
No 10 Press Office and Private Office. The message read μ _Hey team - do you want
to participate in press office secret Santa?_ ¶, followed by a message saying
μ _Spending limit £10_ ¶ and a further message which read μ _We will do gift exchange
and cheese and (lots of) wine on 18th Dec._ ¶ A number of staff replied positively.

On 3 December 2020, an email invitation was sent from the Press Office Mailbox
to members of the No 10 Press Office, which included officials and special
advisers, inviting them to a μ _Wine & Cheese Evening¶_ , to be held from 17.00-21.00
on Friday 18 December 2020. On 7 December 2020, messages were sent via a
second WhatsApp group organising who would provide which type of cheese for
the event.

On 12 December 2020, a number of messages were sent on a third WhatsApp
group, discussing the purchase of a fridge for the office (through individual
contributions). One member of the group said μ _£5 or so from everyone who wants
to contribute would be fab ± thanks team¶_. Another member of the group replied
μ _Done, Looking forZard to a chilled WTF [Wine Time Frida\] ne[t Zeek¶,_ while
another commented _μ...depending on hoZ full it gets Ze can put Frida\¶s cheese in
there._ ¶

On 18 December 2020, a message was sent to a fourth WhatsApp group (whose
membership consisted of Press Office officials, including senior civil servants), at
12.09 as follows:

_³Our current plan is:_

_1630 people put out their cheese and Christmas treats_

_1700 [No 10 Official] kicks off Secret Santa (if \ou¶re alright Zith that [a No 10
official]? We can help give out the presents._

_[No 10 Official] then gives out the quiz and gives people some time to do it before
going through the answers_

_[No 10 Official] then does the weather game - we need to divide the office into two
teams socially distanced along the long bank of desks for this we think_

_Then James [Slack] and Jack [Doyle] do a bit of a jokey highlights and low-lights
of the \ear speech ́_


On the 18 December 2020 at 13.19, the email invitation of 3 December 2020 was
reissued. Instead of μ _Wine & Cheese Evening¶_ it subsequently read μ _End of Year
Meeting with Wine & Cheese_ ¶.

**The event**

The 18 December 2020 was a Friday, when the weekly Press Office meeting and
μWine Time Friday¶ would have normally taken place. It was also the last working
Friday of 2020 and there was a desire to mark the occasion.

Some work did take place in the Press Office and No 10 whilst this event was
underway, in relation to the ongoing negotiations on a trade deal ahead of the UK¶s
exit from the EU scheduled for 31 December 2020; and on the emergence of the
Delta variant of Covid 19, raising issues of what Covid restrictions would be
necessary over the Christmas period with announcements being made the next
day. A number of senior members of the Press Office attended or observed
relevant meetings and discussed follow up action.

The event started by about 18.00 which was later than scheduled. It took place in
the same space as the leaving event on 27 November 2020, in the area just outside
the No 10 Press Office.

A Secret Santa gift exchange took place. There was also a quiz.

An μ _aZards ceremon\¶_ took place, at around 19.45. A No 10 official sent a message
to one of the WhatsApp groups at 19.49 stating μ _prize giving now guys, return_ ¶. The
investigation was informed that this was an extension of the type of awards
ceremony which might take place on μWine Time Friday¶. Those present gathered
together at the meeting table in the small area outside the main Press Office.
Awards certificates were handed out to staff by Jack Doyle, a senior special
adviser. There were about 30 certificates prepared, although not all those awarded
certificates were present. The ceremony lasted between 10-25 minutes and
between 15 and 45 people were in the room during that time.

At approximately 19.45 that evening, a panic alarm button was accidentally
triggered by a member of staff. The custodians on duty responded, as did one of
the police officers on No 10 door duty. They observed a large number of people in
the area outside of the main Press Office and one individual giving a speech. Inside
the Press Office a further 15-20 people were present.

There was food and alcohol available which had been bought and brought in by
staff. Some members of staff drank excessively. The event was crowded and noisy


such that some people working elsewhere in the No 10 building that evening heard
significant levels of noise coming from what they characterised as a μparty¶ in the
Press Office. A cleaner who attended the room the next morning noted that there
had been red wine spilled on one wall and on a number of boxes of photocopier
paper.

The event lasted for several hours, with varying levels of attendance throughout,
including because officials left to attend official meetings. Attendance peaked
during the awards ceremony. No 10 exit logs show a number of members of staff
remaining in the office until after midnight.

**Summary**

On 14 January 202 1 a leaving event took place for two No 10 officials (No 10
officials 1 and 2) in the Pillared Room in No 10. The Prime Minister attended for a
short time to give a leaving speech. Alcohol was available.

**Preparations**

On 7 January 2021 Stuart Glassborow, the Prime Minister¶s Deputy Principal
Private Secretary and line manager of the departing individuals, sent an email
inviting staff to a μ _Virtual Leaving Presentation_ ¶, to be held on 14 January 2021
between 17. 30 - 18 .30 to mark the leaving of two No 10 officials**.** The email
contained only a Microsoft Teams online link; no information was initially given to
suggest an in-person event. This email was subsequently forwarded to


approximately 40 people across No 10, the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury. There
was a link provided in the invitation for those attending virtually.

**Event**

The event began at around 18.00 on 14 January 2021 in the Pillared Room, one
of the larger rooms in No 10. Approximately 15 members of staff from the No 10
Private Office and No 10 Policy Unit attended in person, with up to 30 people joining
virtually. The Prime Minister attended at approximately 18.00 for around ten
minutes in between meetings. He gave a short speech thanking those leaving
before returning to his office. There were further speeches by other members of
No 10 staff. There are photographs of the event.

Following the speeches while some people left, others remained in the Pillared
Room and continued to chat and drink. It is unclear what time the event finished.
We were informed at least some of those present were there beyond 23.00.

**Summary**

On 16 April 202 1 two separate leaving events took place in No 10, one for the
Director of Communications, James Slack, and one for a No 10 official. Alcohol
was available at both events and there were speeches. Senior officials attended.
Both groups met in the No 10 garden later that evening. The events lasted for
several hours. The Prime Minister was not in residence.

**Preparations**

On 7 April 2021 an invitation for a leaving event was sent from the Press Office
Mailbox to at least 77 members of staff in No 10, including the Prime Minister¶s
Private Office, Press Office and others, inviting them to a μ _Team meeting and
leaving Presentation¶_ for James Slack and a Private Office official scheduled for
17.00-19.00 on 29 April 2021. At 12.35 on the same day, the invitation was
forwarded, again by the Press Office Mailbox, to two distribution lists: _μLegislation¶_
and μ _PMPOST - ALL¶._

This original event scheduled for 29 April 2021 did not take place. Instead the
invitation was updated for an event on Friday 16 April 2021 for James Slack¶s
leaving event only. The location now read μ _Pillared Room/Zoom Then The Garden_ ¶.

**The events**

Two leaving events took place on 16 April 2021. One, the event for James Slack
and the other, an event to mark the departure of a No 10 official. This latter event
was organised on the day, by email which sent at 16.26 by a No 10 official to the
No 10 Digital team, No 10 Press Office, Events & Visits and others. There was no
scheduled time for the event on the invitation. This email invitation included a
Microsoft Teams link so that individuals could attend virtually and was called μ _[No
10 official] Leaving Presentation_ ¶. The location was the No 10 Digital Team office
which is situated in the basement of No 10.

The Digital team is part of the No 10 Press Office team and there was considerable
overlap in attendance at the two events. The first, for James Slack, began at
approximately 18.30, with speeches in the Press Office. He wished to thank his
team members individually and to set out future direction for the team. It lasted for
around an hour and there were approximately 45 people in total in attendance both
in the office and with a small number online. Those present in person came from
across No 10, including senior officials. Some joined the event virtually. Wine and
beer had been bought by staff and was consumed by some during the speeches.

Following the speeches, some staff returned to work but others continued chatting
and drinking. They remained for some time and were present when the building


was being locked down for the evening. Those still present were asked to leave
the building by a No 10 custodian. The group then moved into the No 10 garden.

The second event, for the other No 10 official, was held in the offices of the Digital
Team in the basement of No 10. It began at approximately the same time as the
event for the Director of Communications, at around 18.00, but was smaller in
scale, with 15-20 people present, including a special adviser and more junior
officials. There were leaving speeches and a presentation. Wine was available and
music was played from a laptop on top of a printer. A number of those present
drank excessively.

There was mingling between the two events, with some staff moving up and down
the stairs in between the basement and the Press Office. The two groups
eventually joined together in the Downing Street garden. Shortly before 21.30,
there were over 20 people present in the garden, with a number of bottles of
alcohol.

A number of individuals gathered near a child¶s swing/slide in the garden,
damaging it by leaning on and playing with it. This was noticed the next morning
and reported to No 10 staff.

At this time, the custodian staff at No 10 continued to lock down the building. They
noted that groups of individuals had gone into the garden. The group began to
break up and return into the main building at around 21.30.

The No 10 entry logs show that a number of people left No 10 at this point. They
were encouraged by the custodian to use the rear exit of No 10. Some individuals
remained in the building and carried on drinking alcohol until the early hours. Exit
logs indicate that some left after midnight and others between 01. 45 - 02 .45. Two
members of staff stayed later still, with one leaving at 03 .11 and the last leaving at
0 4:20.


**Conclusions**

1. The general findings set out in my update of 31st January 2022 still stand.
2. Whatever the initial intent, what took place at many of these gatherings and the
    way in which they developed was not in line with Covid guidance at the time.
    Even allowing for the extraordinary pressures officials and advisers were under,
    the factual findings of this report illustrate some attitudes and behaviours
    inconsistent with that guidance. It is also clear, from the outcome of the police
    investigation, that a large number of individuals (83) who attended these events
    breached Covid regulations and therefore Covid guidance.
3. I have already commented in my update on what I found to be failures of
    leadership and judgment in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. The events that I
    investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events
    should not have been allowed to happen. It is also the case that some of the
    more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these
    events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders. The senior
    leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for
    this culture.
4. In my update I made a number of general limited findings, I am pleased
    progress is being made in addressing the issues I raised. I commented on the
    fragmentary and complicated leadership structures in No 10. Since my update
    there have been changes to the organisation and management of Downing
    Street and the Cabinet Office with the aim of creating clearer lines of leadership
    and accountability and now these need the chance and time to bed in.
5. I found that some staff had witnessed or been subjected to behaviours at work
    which they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly. I
    was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment
    of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable. I am reassured to see
    that steps have since been taken to introduce more easily accessible means by
    which to raise concerns electronically, in person or online, including directly with
    the Permanent Secretary in No 10. I hope that this will truly embed a culture
    that welcomes and creates opportunities for challenge and speaking up at all
    levels.
6. I also made a recommendation that steps should be taken to ensure that every
    Government Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the
    consumption of alcohol in the workplace. Since then guidance has been issued
    to all Government Departments.


7. The matter of what disciplinary action should now take place is outside of the
    scope of this report and is for others to consider. Nothing set out in this report
    can be taken as constituting a disciplinary investigation or findings of fact
    appropriate for such a purpose. However, I do offer a reflection: while there is
    no excuse for some of the behaviour set out here it is important to acknowledge
    that those in the most junior positions attended gatherings at which their seniors
    were present, or indeed organised. I have no doubt that they will have taken
    the learning from this experience and, while this is not a matter for me, I hope
    this will be taken into account in considering any disciplinary action.
8. Many will be dismayed that behaviour of this kind took place on this scale at the
    heart of Government. The public have a right to expect the very highest
    standards of behaviour in such places and clearly what happened fell well short
    of this. It is my firm belief, however, that these events did not reflect the
    prevailing culture in Government and the Civil Service at the time. Many
    thousands of people up and down the country worked tirelessly to deliver in
    unprecedented times. I remain immensely proud to be a civil servant and of
    the work of the service and the wider public sector during the pandemic.

#### INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGED GATHERINGS ON GOVERNMENT PREMISES

#### DURING COVID RESTRICTIONS - UPDATE

1. On 8 December 2021 the Prime Minister asked the Cabinet Secretary to carry out
    an investigation into allegations reported in the media relating to gatherings in
    No10 Downing Street and the Department for Education during November and
    December 2020.
2. On 17 December 2021 the Cabinet Secretary recused himself from the
    investigation as a result of allegations concerning an online quiz held by his private

    point that I was asked to lead this work.
3. The terms of reference for the investigation were published on 9 December 2021

```
**Methodology**

6. There has been widespread public interest in, and concern about, a number of
    gatherings taking place in No 10 Downing Street and Whitehall during periods of
    national Covid restrictions, where their necessity for work purposes has been open
    to question. My task has been to establish, as far as possible, the facts surrounding
    these gatherings.
7. In carrying out my investigation I have been supported by a small team of senior
    civil servants in the Cabinet Office, who have no connection with the events under
    examination and who are bound by the requirements of the Civil Service Code.
    We carried out interviews of over 70 individuals, some more than once, and
    examined relevant documentary and digital information, such as emails; Whatsapp
    messages; text messages; photographs and building entry and exit logs_._ This has
    also included searches of official records. As such, extensive substantive factual
    information is now available and has been compiled by me and my team to fulfil
    my obligation to establish the facts. The investigative work is now essentially
    complete.
8. The Treasury Solicitor and Daniel Stilitz QC have provided independent advice as
    to the process.
9. It is not for me to make a judgment on whether the criminal law has been broken;
    that is properly a matter for law enforcement. In line with my terms of reference I
    have been in regular contact with the Metropolitan Police as my work has
    progressed in order for them to take decisions on the gatherings under
    examination, including whether to launch their own investigation.


10. The Metropolitan Police has now confirmed that as a result of information provided
    by the Cabinet Office investigation team, as well as assessments made by
    Metropolitan Police officers, they are investigating the events on the dates set out
    above with the exception of the gatherings on:
       - 15 May 2020
       - 27 November 2020
       - 10 December 2020
       - 15 December 2020
11. The police have confirmed that on the basis of the information available the
    gatherings on these four dates are not considered to have reached the threshold
    for criminal investigation.
12. No conclusions should be drawn, or inferences made from this other than it is now
    for the police to consider the relevant material in relation to those incidents. The
    police have also said this does not in itself mean that they will decide to take further
    action or that there has necessarily been a breach of the regulations.
13. At the request of the police I have provided the material compiled in the course of
    my investigation relevant to the gatherings that they are now investigating. I have
    also been asked to retain all the other information collected in the course of this
    work, which I have confirmed that I will do. I will therefore ensure the secure
    storage and safekeeping of all the information gathered until such time as it may
    be required further. I will not be circulating the information internally within
    government, it has been provided in confidence to the Cabinet Office investigation
    team and it is important that this confidence is maintained to protect the integrity of
    the process.
14. As a result of the Metropolitan Police’s investigations, and so as not to prejudice
    the police investigative process, they have told me that it would only be appropriate
    to make minimal reference to the gatherings on the dates they are investigating.
    Unfortunately, this necessarily means that I am extremely limited in what I can say
    about those events and it is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report
    setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to
    gather.
15. In respect of the gatherings that the Metropolitan Police has assessed as not
    reaching the threshold for criminal investigation; they have not requested any
    limitations be placed on the description of those events, however, I have decided
    not to publish factual accounts in relation to those four dates. I do not feel that I am
    able to do so without detriment to the overall balance of the findings.
16. More generally, I did consider whether it would be better to pause, as provided for
    in the terms of reference, and wait until the conclusion of the police investigation
    before publishing anything. However, given the widespread public interest in, and
    concern about, these matters, and to avoid further delay, I am providing an update
    on the investigation and I am setting out some general findings now. I have not
    made comment on whether individual gatherings were in line with the relevant


```
guidance and regulations in place at the time. I did not judge it appropriate to do
so given the police investigation that is now underway.
```
**Context**

17. The outbreak and spread of SARs Covid-19 represented a global public health
    crisis without parallel in living memory. In the United Kingdom it had a seismic
    impact on every aspect of life in the country. In response, to help control the spread
    of the virus and to keep the most vulnerable safe, the UK Government put in place
    far reaching restrictions on citizens that had direct and material impact on their
    lives, livelihood and liberties.
18. From 26 March 2020 the law in England required everyone to remain in their
    homes unless certain, very limited exemptions applied. Restrictions were
    temporarily eased over the summer period in 2020 until most remaining national
    restrictions were removed on 4 July 2020. Restrictions were then reintroduced in
    gradations in the autumn culminating in the UK Government announcing from 5
    November 2020 restrictions on movements and gatherings in England, essentially
    requiring people to stay at home. Restrictions on gatherings of two or more people
    applied in London through December 2020 and the first months of 2021. Indoor
    mixing of two or more households was not permitted again until 17 May 2021. A
    chronology of the main changes is at Annex B.
19. In line with those rules the vast majority of staff in Government Departments
    worked from home. The Civil Service, along with the rest of the public sector, went
    to great lengths to reconfigure the provision and delivery of public services and
    support for businesses almost overnight. Many private sector businesses and
    other organisations, large and small, all over the UK, were also working hard to
    deal with the pandemic both in terms of managing their businesses, their
    livelihoods and those of their employees, as well as providing vital support to the
    national effort to respond to the virus.
20. A small number of Government officials and special advisers, because of the
    nature of their jobs directly supporting the Prime Minister and other Ministers,
    continued to attend their offices for the purposes of work, as permitted by an
    exemption under the regulations.
21. In particular, No 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet Office were at the centre of
    the Government’s response to the pandemic. Tight knit groups of officials and
    advisers worked long hours under difficult conditions in buildings that could not be
    easily adapted as Covid secure workplaces. No 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet
    Office in 70 Whitehall are closely interconnected, with staff moving regularly
    between the two buildings as part of their daily work. The Prime Minister’s flat and
    the Downing Street garden are in close proximity to the offices and serve a dual
    office and private purpose.
22. Those challenges, however, also applied to key and frontline workers across the
    country who were working under equally, if not more, demanding conditions, often
    at risk to their own health. It is important to remember the stringency of the public


```
health regulations in force in England over the relevant periods and that criminal
sanctions were applied to many found to be in breach of them. The hardship under
which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while
observing the Government’s regulations and guidance rigorously are known only
too well.
```
23. Every citizen has been impacted by the pandemic. Everyone has made personal
    sacrifices, some the most profound, having been unable to see loved ones in their
    last moments or care for vulnerable family and friends.

```
It is with that context in mind that I make the following general limited findings.
```
**General findings**

```
i. Against the backdrop of the pandemic, when the Government was asking
citizens to accept far-reaching restrictions on their lives, some of the behaviour
surrounding these gatherings is difficult to justify.
```
```
ii. At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to
observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of
Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population
at the time.
```
```
iii. At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening
across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these
gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear
to the public. There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts
of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. Some of the events should
not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been
allowed to develop as they did.
```
```
iv. The excessive consumption of alcohol is not appropriate in a professional
workplace at any time. Steps must be taken to ensure that every Government
Department has a clear and robust policy in place covering the consumption of
alcohol in the workplace.
```
```
v. The use of the garden at No 10 Downing Street should be primarily for the
Prime Minister and the private residents of No 10 and No 11 Downing Street.
During the pandemic it was often used as an extension of the workplace as a
more covid secure means of holding group meetings in a ventilated space. This
was a sensible measure that staff appreciated, but the garden was also used
for gatherings without clear authorisation or oversight. This was not
appropriate. Any official access to the space, including for meetings, should be
by invitation only and in a controlled environment.
```
```
vi. Some staff wanted to raise concerns about behaviours they witnessed at work
but at times felt unable to do so. No member of staff should feel unable to report
or challenge poor conduct where they witness it. There should be easier ways
```

```
for staff to raise such concerns informally, outside of the line management
chain.
```
```
vii. The number of staff working in No 10 Downing Street has steadily increased in
recent years. In terms of size, scale and range of responsibility it is now more
akin to a small Government Department than purely a dedicated Prime
Minister’s office. The structures that support the smooth operation of Downing
Street, however, have not evolved sufficiently to meet the demands of this
expansion. The leadership structures are fragmented and complicated and this
has sometimes led to the blurring of lines of accountability. Too much
responsibility and expectation is placed on the senior official whose principal
function is the direct support of the Prime Minister. This should be addressed
as a matter of priority.
```
**Conclusion**

24. The gatherings within the scope of this investigation are spread over a 20-month
    period – a period that has been unique in recent times in terms of the complexity
    and breadth of the demands on public servants and indeed the general public. The
    whole of the country rose to the challenge. Ministers, special advisers and the Civil
    Service, of which I am proud to be a part, were a key and dedicated part of that
    national effort. However, as I have noted, a number of these gatherings should
    not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did. There
    is significant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed
    immediately across Government. This does not need to wait for the police
    investigations to be concluded.


**ANNEX A: Terms of Reference: Investigations into staff gatherings in No10
Downing Street and the Department for Education**

The Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Secretary to carry out investigations into:

```
● allegations made of a gathering in No10 Downing Street on 27 November
2020;
● a gathering at the Department for Education on 10 December 2020; and
● allegations made of a gathering in No10 Downing Street on 18 December
2020.
```
Where there are credible allegations relating to other gatherings, these may be
investigated.

The primary purpose will be to establish swiftly a general understanding of the nature
of the gatherings, including attendance, the setting and the purpose, with reference
to adherence to the guidance in place at the time.

If required, the investigations will establish whether individual disciplinary action is
warranted.

The work will be undertaken by officials in the Cabinet Office at the direction of the
Cabinet Secretary, with support from the Government Legal Department.
The team will have access to all relevant records, and be able to speak to members
of staff.

As with all internal investigations, if during the course of the work any evidence
emerges of behaviour that is potentially a criminal offence, the matter will be referred
to the police and the Cabinet Office’s work may be paused. Matters relating to
adherence to the law are properly for the police to investigate and the Cabinet Office
will liaise with them as appropriate.

Any matters relating to the conduct of Ministers should follow the process set out in
the Ministerial Code in the normal way.

All Ministers, Special Advisers, and civil servants will be expected to co-operate with
the investigations.

Any staff with information relevant to the investigations should provide it to the
Cabinet Office investigation team.

Pastoral care and support will be provided to all staff involved.

The findings of the investigations will be made public. Following the long-standing
practice of successive administrations, any specific HR action against individuals will
remain confidential.


**Annex B: Timeline of Regulations**

26 March 2020: restrictions on leaving one’s home without a reasonable excuse, first
announced on 23 March, come into legal effect in England. Very limited exceptions
permit travel to work where it is not reasonably possible to work from home.
Participating in a gathering of more than two persons is prohibited except where the
gathering “is essential for work purposes”.

13 May 2020: leaving or being outside one’s home without a reasonable excuse
continues to be prohibited Some restrictions are relaxed to allow meetings outdoors
for exercise or recreation with one person from another household. Guidance
encourages those who cannot work from home to go back to work. At work, social
distancing advice applies with workplaces required “to avoid crowding and minimise
opportunities for the virus to spread by maintaining a distance of at least 2 metres (3
steps) between individuals wherever possible”

1 June 2020: England moves to “step 2” of the government’s roadmap in which
restrictions on leaving one’s home are removed. Gatherings of two or more persons
indoors and more than six outdoors are prohibited. An exception permits gatherings
that are “reasonably necessary .... for work purposes”

15 June 2020: Non-essential retail businesses are permitted to reopen and individual
prayer in places of worship is allowed again

4 July 2020: most remaining national restrictions are removed as pubs and restaurants
reopen. Gatherings of more than 30 persons are prohibited

5 July 2020: despite the removal of most national restrictions, local restrictions are
retained and reintroduced during July and August in certain areas, including Leicester,
Bolton, Greater Manchester and the North East

14 September 2020: a restriction on gatherings of more than six persons indoors and
outdoors (the “rule of six”) is introduced, subject to exceptions which include where
“the gathering is reasonably necessary.... for work purposes”

14 October 2020: a tiered system of progressive restrictions is introduced. London is
moved to Tier 2 (“High”), from 17 October, in which two or more persons are prohibited
from meeting indoors

5 November 2020: a second national lockdown is introduced which requires people to
stay at home and which prohibits gatherings with people from other households except
for permitted exceptions, including where the “gathering is reasonably necessary ....
for work purposes”

2 December 2020: England is divided again into three tiers, with London in Tier 2 in
which gatherings of two or more persons continue to be prohibited unless an
exception, such as where the gathering is reasonably necessary for work purposes,
applies. Government guidance for the Christmas period on visiting pubs and
restaurants advises: “although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not


have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is
not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.”

16 December 2020: London is moved to Tier 3. Indoor gatherings of two or more
persons from different households continue to be prohibited. Social distancing remains
the rule at work, with offices advised “to maintain social distancing guidelines (2m, or
1m with risk mitigation where 2m is not viable), wherever possible, including while
arriving at and departing from work, while in work and when travelling between sites”.

20 December 2020: London is moved to a newly-created Tier 4 with much of South
East England, to help control the Alpha variant. The “stay at home restrictions” prohibit
leaving one’s home except for permitted purposes

6 January 2021: All areas of England are moved into Tier 4’s stay at home restrictions.
This is the third national lockdown. The stay at home restrictions prohibit leaving one’s
home except for permitted exceptions which include where it is “reasonably necessary
.... for the purposes of work” and where it is not reasonably possible to work from
home

29 March 2021: All areas of England move to Step 1 and the “stay at home restrictions”
are lifted. Gatherings of two or more persons indoors or more than six persons
outdoors are prohibited, subject to exceptions which include where a gathering is
“reasonably necessary... for work purposes”

12 April 2021: All of England moves to Step 2. Non essential retail businesses and
many outdoor venues reopen but the restrictions on social mixing indoors and
outdoors do not change

17 May 2021: All of England moves to Step 3, permitting six persons or two
households to mix indoors and up to 30 people to mix outdoors
